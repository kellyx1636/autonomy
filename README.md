At this point of my SEP12 class, we are practicing autonomy, the quality or state of being self governing (definition from my teacher, Mr. Mueller). Follow me in this educational journey, which is filled with confusion, "a-ha!" moments, mistakes and more by reading the entries that I have posted so far!
