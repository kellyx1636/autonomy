# Entry 5: Learning Cross-site Request Forgery and Needing To Focus Even More 
...  

##### Some Side Notes: 
If you would like to follow along with what you will read in my entry, click on this link: [Hacksplaining: Cross-site Request Forgery](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/csrf). 

When you click on the link, you will notice that there are circles on the top-left corner. Those circles are like the steps or slides of a presentation. You can click on them to go back and forward. 

## Cross-site Request Forgery 
**_Circle 1-3_**

While a website is being made, a programmer usually makes the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end). For the front-end, the client would be approached with forums where he/she enters input information. On the other hand, the back-end is where the inputs are being processed and URLs being used, which then, leads to the result(s) or output(s) to appear.  

The possibility of having requests being made to the server-side of the code varies, and it does not have to be from the client-side. From having inputs, outputs, and requests being involved, sites/pages are connected, which is "one of the most powerful" feature of how the internet is wired (according to Hacksplaining. With these sites/pages being connected, there is still a common security flaw that can cause problems and that would be cross-sire request forgery(CSRF).  

This security flaw takes place when a user is fooled into using the hacker's/attacker's site, which will create a request to your site. Your server would process this attack with its HTTP request (as in like a URL) and believe that it is made from a legitimate user.

At this point of the Hacksplaining lesson, it leads me to a simulation of this security flaw taking its course. The simulation seems to be modeled like Twitter, which I have never used before.
