# Entry #2: Continuing Learning  
For this week, I continued to learn the topics that were presented to me. The one that I learned was Directory Transversal. 

##### Some Side Notes: 
If you would like to follow along with what you will read in my entry, click on this link: [Hacksplaining: Direct Transversal](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/directory-traversal). 

When you click on the link, you will notice that there are circles on the top-left corner. Those circles are like the steps or slides of a presentation. You can click on them to go back and forward. [Here is how they look!](../images/meaning-of-circles.lnk)

## Directory Transversal
"What is directory transversal?", you may ask. Well, the purpose of directory transversal is to prevent hackers from being able to locate sensitive files of a user through a file path (URL).  

The first three circles/parts for this topic only gave me some information directly. 
* 1st circle: There are two types of websites. Some are made to be accessible by the user's browser and others are not. For the ones that are made to be accessible, it could be through the usage of JavaScript and CSS files. 
* 2nd circle: URLs are usually used in web servers to specify template files and assests in a file system. If you compare how you got to access a specific file and its URL structure, you can see that they show the same thing.  
* 3rd circle: If your server is not wired well and fails to keep certain files away from the public's view, that could be another way for hackers to obtain your files. 

After learning about these facts, I am presented with a simulation.
